| Researchers ?         | Miguel Nicolelis. And the researchers who did the experiment in the part that the author called " the new paper " are : Linxing Jiang, Andrea Stocco, Darby M.Losey and Rajesh P.N.Rao |
| Professions ?         | Nicolelis is a Brazilian scientist ans a physician. The "new paper" researchers are different kind of researchers all working at University of Washington in Seattle, USA.|
| Published in ?        | Sientific American |
| General Topic ?       | Brains can communicate together, using their electrical activity to send magnetic signals that can be detected from an other brain. |
| Patients ?            | Nicolelis used rat's brain.The other experiment involved human's brain |
| Procedure ?           | Nicolelis experiment: He connected together the brains of few rats, using specific electrodes  He described it as the first " organic computer". The rats in the network learned to synchronize the electrical activity of their nerve cells to the same extent as those in a single brain.The new paper experiment:They linked together the brain activity of three humans , creating a small network. The three person were in separate rooms and they had to collaborate to orient a block like in the game TETRIS. Two person were the " senders", they could see the gap and new if the block needed to be rotated. The third was the "receiver", he was blinded and he was the onethat rotated the block.     |
| Conclusion ?          | This biological supercomputer of networked animal brains (BrainNet) ) was effective. On average, they achieved greater than 80 percent accuracy in completing the task. It is the first report where humans brain were connected in an completely noninvasive manner. |
| Remaining questions ? | Could such a network be a faster, more efficient and smarter way of working together ? Enable people to work across language barriers? |
