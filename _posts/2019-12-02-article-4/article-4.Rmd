| Researchers ?                |   Some researchers that stepped in the study were Nicolas Schuck and Yael Niv.            |
| Professions ?                 | Nicolas Schuck is the lead author of the paper and a neuroscientist at the Max Planck Institute for Human Development in Berlin. And Yeal Niv is a neuroscientist at Princeton University.|
| Published in ?                |  On the 27th june 2019 in *The Science*                               |
| General topic ?               |  The study is about how the hippocampus learns and hard wires certain experiences into memory. When we are following a particular behavior, the hippocampus replays that behavior repeatedly until it's incorporate. The study also report on how the hippocampus tracks our brainâ€™s decision-making centers to remember our past choices.                     |
| Patients                      | The study used 33 human beings                      |
| Procedure                     |  33 participants were presented with a series of images containing both a face and a house. They had to judge the age of either one or the other. While engaged in these tasks, the subjects underwent functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), which allows researchers to monitor brain metabolic activity related to areas of the brain that are active at a given time. The imaging allowed the authors to view the patterns of activity in different brain regions before, during and after the decision task.  Following 40 minutes of this exercise, participants underwent brain scanning at rest for five minutes. The fMRI patterns recorded in the hippocampus at rest seemed to re-create snippets of activity that occurred during the decision-making task. And they did so again and again.              |
| Conclusions/discovery ?       |  According to Mr Schunk, replay of task and decision sequences in the resting hippocampus helps train the cortex to better solve similar tasks in the future. And based on Mr Niv, replay in the hippocampus is not only critical to forming memories but also to learning which of our behaviors and decisions are most effective at accomplishing a goal and so should be repeated  |
| Remaining question ? | One remaining question is whether a role for replay exists during dreaming ?|
